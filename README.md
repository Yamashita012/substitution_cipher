**Title: Substitution Cipher in Python**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the Substitution Cipher project implemented in Python! This project demonstrates a simple yet effective encryption technique known as the substitution cipher. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a randomly shuffled set of characters.

**Features:**

- Encryption and decryption of text messages.
- ASCII art banner for visual appeal.
- Random shuffling of characters for encryption.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/substitution-cipher-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd substitution-cipher-python
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```
   python3 substitution_cipher.py
   ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**
   - Enter text to encrypt or decrypt as prompted.
   - Enjoy encoding and decoding secret messages!

**Usage:**

- This project can be used to understand the basics of cryptography and the substitution cipher technique.
- It's a great tool for educational purposes or for creating simple encryption solutions.
